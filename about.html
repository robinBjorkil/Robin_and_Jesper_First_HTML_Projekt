    <h2>J&R Foods believe programmers are generally bad at taking breaks.<br/>
        This may be because programming is so much fun! Never the less, taking<br/>
        a well deserved break for a good meal now and then will in the long run<br/>
        create better and cleaner code! Sometimes we need inspiration for a qick<br/>
        meal because we need to deliver before deadline! On this website you find<br/>
        all the recepies you need to make quick and very tasty meals!
